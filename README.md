Materials for evaluating OA water parameters with crab demographics: results [here](https://fawda123.github.io/crab_eval/results.pdf)

## To do

* crab abundance v temp and ara, fit bimodal curve to find optimum

* What do the depth categories for env data mean?  Are they at the depth or integrated?

* Biplots of bio v env, what's correlated and by depth

* Find best correlation v depth integration (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.) for each response variable, or find best explanatory model

* Add sig values for model parameters in the tables
